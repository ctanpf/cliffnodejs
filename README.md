# [My Nodejs site](http://clifftan.azurewebsites.net)

This is my second site. Check out [my first site] (https://github.com/ptopenny/ptopenny.github.io)
The initial site is generated by Github itself and I have worked it purely to refresh my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. 
This second site is still using the same resource but it is powered by Node.js and Express.js.

*(check my github for that !)*

After diving into Node.js world, I tried to export my exisiting site to Node.js. Express.js is a really powerful
web server module which give me more understanding in managing middleware, creating server, and routing. This site
is hosted on Azure.
